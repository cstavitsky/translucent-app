##A tool to be a better employee
After reading [an article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140613164212-9522584-how-to-go-from-working-60-hours-a-week-to-40-by-sending-2-emails-a-week) on how a couple simple emails to one's boss could result in working fewer hours per week, I decided to implement the idea in a basic app. 

##Functionality
Built on Ruby/Rails with substantial use of javascript as well. Users input their boss's email and the tasks they plan to complete in the upcoming week; the app provides a template that creates a live-updating email template via javascript. The user can then actually send the email to his/her boss.
